Key Takeaways:

1) DO NOT EDIT THE BASE GAME DATA FOLDER. Keep all mod edits in MO2 Virtual File System
2) We are using a mutex like system - update in the discord if you are working (or create a text file in source/plugin). NO ONE ELSE WORKS ON THE PLUGIN (.esp) UNTIL YOU RELEASE THIS. Update in discord (/delete file) once you are done.
3) Main is for STABLE build in a CLEAN MO2 Profile, dev is for integration, with feature branches off of that. only the active editor merges into dev.
4) We will need git LFS. This should be automatic with gitattributes
5) RUN XEDIT AFTER A WORK SESSION.
